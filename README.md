## Repeated k-Fold Cross-Validation for Model Evaluation

This repository contains code and a tutorial on implementing repeated k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation in Python using the scikit-learn library. 

### Overview

The k-fold cross-validation procedure is a standard method for estimating the performance of a machine learning algorithm on a dataset. However, a single run of k-fold cross-validation may result in a noisy estimate of model performance. Repeated k-fold cross-validation provides a way to improve this estimate by repeating the cross-validation procedure multiple times and reporting the mean result across all runs.

### Tutorial Content

- **Introduction:** Explanation of the importance of model evaluation and the need for robust evaluation techniques.
- **k-Fold Cross-Validation:** Overview of the k-fold cross-validation procedure and its implementation using scikit-learn.
- **Repeated k-Fold Cross-Validation:** Introduction to repeated k-fold cross-validation as a method to improve the estimation of model performance.
- **Implementation in Python:** Step-by-step guide on implementing repeated k-fold cross-validation in Python, including dataset creation, cross-validation configuration, model creation, evaluation, and result reporting.
- **Choosing the Number of Repeats:** Discussion on selecting an appropriate number of repeats for repeated k-fold cross-validation and interpreting the results.
- **Box and Whisker Plot:** Demonstration of using box and whisker plots to summarize the distribution of scores for different numbers of repeats.

### Usage
